# Expandable Mass Storage Interface (EMSI)
This script is an Expandable Mass Storage Interface (EMSI). It takes data from your chestmonster and displays it all on easy to read monitors. The display counts items by amount, and would display 2 stacks of a block as 128. When value exceed thousands, numbers are abbreviated to K, or to M for millions. Items are displayed on monitors dynamically, rows get added with more monitor width.

1. The likelihood of someone needing to store over 999 million of 1 item is low and slows the script down a lot so millions is assumed to be the upper limit.
